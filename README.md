Global Temperature Analysis Project
Introduction
This project enables users to analyze time series data related to global temperature and visualize the results through simple plots. The tasks outlined below guide users through the process of accessing, processing, and visualizing temperature data using the xarray library.

Project Structure
The project is divided into three main steps:

(a) Open File and Plot Fraction of Data
In this step, users will learn how to open a file, select a specific portion of the data, and plot it using xarray.

(b) Calculate Daily Mean Global Temperature and Plot Time Series
Users will calculate the daily mean global temperature from the provided dataset and plot the resulting time series. 

(c) Calculate Monthly Mean Temperature and Plot Global Maps
This step involves calculating the mean temperature for each month (January to May) and plotting the data on global maps.

Importance of xarray
Utilizing xarray for this project is convinient due to its ability to handle large datasets, providing easy access, analysis, and visualization functionalities. With xarray, users can perform complex operations on multidimensional data structures.

Usage
The project is available in .py format and can be downloaded for use in any software supporting Python scripts.
Users can also run the project in environments such as JupyterLab by copying the code and executing it interactively.
To use the project with different datasets, users need to modify the file path according to the data used. Additionally, variable names may require adjustments to reflect the content of the dataset accurately.

Instructions
Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
Modify the file path and variable names as necessary for your dataset.
Execute the Python script to perform the desired analysis and visualization tasks.
