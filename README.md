# assignmentgroup2
This assignment assesses your ability to work with github and xarray, topics that were covered during lectures and exercises. The assignment will be done in groups of 3 students each, assigned randomly.

The tasks are as follows:

1. Create a new project in github.

2. Produce a README file that describes the contents of your project.

3. Develop a python code that uses xarray to:

(a) open the file ERA5_2mTemp_19900101-19900531_00h.nc in the shared data/Temperature/ERA5 folder and plot the temperature on January 1, 1990 on a map

(b) calculate daily mean global temperature and plot the time series

(c) calculate the mean temperature for each month (January-May) and plot the data on (five) global maps.

4. Submit the README file and the complete python code, along with the link to your github repository before the deadline. Please make sure that I can access the repository, either by making it public or by explicitly granting me access.
